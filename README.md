## Introduction

Dappscription is a service for anyone to create subscription-based services for anyone else.

Smart contracts are supposed to be immutable, but **services**, or products, are not. We believe that products that utilize smart contracts should keep iterating and provide the best services to the users, and we are here to provide the infra to make that easier for every devs to sustain their business, and focus on building.

### I'm a Service Provider

As a service provider (protocol, aggregators, frontend devs), you can register your project here with a simple `createProject` call with your plan detail.

After registration, you can use our React component to easily distinguish if a connected wallet is a subscribed user or not, and choose to disable some advanced feature based on that.

Dappscription, as permission-less contract, will not collect any fees, every penny goes to your wallet. You can automatically collect all your "revenue" on our management UI.
### I'm a user

You can use **Dappscription** to manage all your subscriptions to advanced services, make sure you don't pay more than what you're suppose to.
